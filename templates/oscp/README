                     AutoRpt OSCP README
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Only four IP addresses are stubbed in the targets.txt file.
The buffer overflow system is intentionally excluded from this file.
You are welcome to add it to the list, thus having all five OSCP 
targets listed, but this will effect overall scan times if used as
an input file to autorecon, nmapAutomator, or nmap.
