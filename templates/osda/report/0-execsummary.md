The student will be required to fill out this exam report fully and to include the following sections:

1. Overall High-Level Summary of level of compromise
2. Detailed walkthrough of attacker actions in each phase
3. Each finding with included screenshots, explanations, event / log entries, and KQL queries if applicable.

# High-Level Summary

This report details and documents the attacks observed against the Offensive Security OSDA exam network.

The attacker organization started by performing a brute force against an internet accessible RDP server called APPSRV02 and obtained administrative access. This led to a complete compromise of the server.

Next the attacker performed lateral movement to the internal server APPSRV02 by reusing stolen credentials from APPSRV02, this also led to a complete compromise of APPSRV03.
