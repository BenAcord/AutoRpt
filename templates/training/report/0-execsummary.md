# Training Report

## Introduction

Describe the overall lab purpose: Hack the Box, Proving Grounds, Virtual Hacking Labs, Try Hack Me, VulnHub, CTF, etc.

## Objective

The objective of this assessment is to perform a penetration test against a single target for the purpose of personal growth and development.

# High-Level Summary

Briefly describe the target

|IP ADDRESS|HOSTNAME|NAME OF INITIAL EXPLOIT|
|---|---|---|
|192.168.xx.xx|BOILERPLATE_TARGET|Name of initial exploit|

## Recommendations

I recommend patching the vulnerabilities identified during the testing to ensure that an attacker cannot exploit these systems in the future.  One thing to remember is that these systems require frequent patching and once patched, should remain on a regular patch program to protect additional vulnerabilities that are discovered at a later date.

# Methodologies

I utilized a widely adopted approach to performing penetration testing for assessing network systems.  The details below describe how I was able to identify and exploit the target.

## Pre-Engagement Scoping

The preliminary aspects of the engagement are provided by the training platform and no additional authorization is needed.

## Information Gathering

The information gathering portion of a penetration test focuses on identifying the scope of the penetration test.  During this penetration test, I was tasked with exploiting the exam network.
The specific target was: BOILERPLATE_TARGET.

## Penetration

The penetration testing portions of the assessment focus heavily on gaining access.  During this penetration test, I was able to successfully gain **user & root** level access to the system.

## Maintaining Access

While maintaining access to a system is important to us as attackers, ensuring that we can get back into a system after it has been exploited is invaluable, as this is a training environment no extra steps were taken to ensure access is maintained long-term.

## House Cleaning

The house cleaning portions of the assessment ensures that remnants of the penetration test are removed. Often fragments of tools or user accounts are left on an organization's computer which can cause security issues down the road. Ensuring that we are meticulous and no remnants of our penetration test are left over is important.

After collecting trophies from the target completed, I removed all user accounts and passwords as well as any files or services dropped on the system.

The lab administrators or other students should not have to remove any user accounts or services from the system.
