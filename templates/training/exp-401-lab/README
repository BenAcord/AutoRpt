                     AutoRpt TRAINING README
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Only one IP addresses is stubbed in the targets.txt file for use with 
any recon tools that take a file for input (eg. autorecon, nmap, etc.).

The training report is a simplistic, single page intended for a single 
system write up.  A good option for Hack the Box, Try Hack Me, VulnHub, 
or a college assignment.

When complete with the write-up use the following command to produce a 
PDF file.  This is the only output produced by the finalize parameter.
