## Introduction

Describe the lab and the target system and a high-level summary of the results.

## Recommendations

I recommend patching the vulnerabilities identified during the testing to ensure that an attacker cannot exploit these systems in the future.  One thing to remember is that these systems require frequent patching and once patched, should remain on a regular patch program to protect additional vulnerabilities that are discovered at a later date.

## System: BOILERPLATE_TARGET

### Service Enumeration

The service enumeration portion of a penetration test focuses on gathering information about what services are alive on a system or systems.  This is valuable for an attacker as it provides detailed information on potential attack vectors into a system.  Understanding what applications are running on the system gives an attacker needed information before performing the actual penetration test.  In some cases, some ports may not be listed.

### Exploitation & Low Privilege Shell

Steps to reproduce:

1. A 
2. B
3. C

**Proof of Concept Code**

If you have not made any modifications to an exploit, you should only provide the URL where the exploit can be found. Do not include the full unmodified code, especially if it is several pages long.  
If you have modified an exploit, you should include:

- The modified exploit code
- The URL to the original exploit code
- The command used to generate any shellcode (if applicable)
- Highlighted changes you have made
- An explanation of why those changes were made

```Bash
echo Code goes here.

**Exploit Code**

If you have not made any modifications to an exploit, you should only provide the URL where the exploit can be found. Do not include the full unmodified code, especially if it is several pages long.  
If you have modified an exploit, you should include:

- Highlighted changes you have made
- An explanation of why those changes were made
